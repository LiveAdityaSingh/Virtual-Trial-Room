# Real Time Pose Estimation 


This is the technique to generate 3D vision coordinates from the 2D input. It completely uses a mathematical model and doesnot use any pre-trained model. This is integrated with the pose estimation method to get the 3D coordinates of various body points. 
<br>
This is a award winning approach felicitated by ISRO, to be one of its kind in its field. Awarded as the best innovative project.<b> We are planning to use this in virtual fitting technique instead of 2D pose estimation.</b>
